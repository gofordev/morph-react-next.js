        "When a trade is started the seen rate is always displayed below each selected asset. The final rate will depend on when your deposit gets confirmed, which causes MorphToken to perform the asset exchange. Compared to the best bid/ask price from a regular exchange, it's expected that the service fee stays within 0.5% to 0.7% of that.",
        "If the request involves a single asset, e.g. forward bitcoin to one or more bitcoin addresses, a 0.25% fee is used (NOTE: changed from 0.1% to 0.25% November 12, 2018).",

        "A request for trading XMR for BTC was created. When XMR is sent to the deposit address given by MorphToken (not shown above), 100% of it will be converted to BTC.",
        "When the request was created, a rate of 1 XMR = 0.0161552 BTC was seen. Assuming the final rate is the same, depositing 1 XMR would give 0.0161552 - 0.001 BTC."
